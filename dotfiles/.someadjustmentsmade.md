### Some of the tweaks I had to make to the XPS 13 (9350) to run Arch

* Enabled touchpad 'touch press' using `xinput set-prop 16 320 1` (refer to `xinput` manual)
* Used `xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'` to track multimedia keys that were not working
* Used `xmodmap` and `.xmodmap` to map those missing commands (mainly audio controls)
* Running `dhcpcd.service` and `wpa_supplicant@**interface**.service` as network managers for WiFi
..* Had to create a custom service item to enable my wifi card during boot (associated to a (Kernel bug)[http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201853])
